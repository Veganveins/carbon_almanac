# Units

All data files are available from three different angles:

#### Per 100 g Protein

Advantage: Nice to see a comparison of protein since meat eaters will say that meat has more protein than vegetarian alternatives like eggs / tofu / beans.

Disadantage: Hard to compare foods like vegetables / oil (which are not traditional sources of protein) to meat

#### Per 1000 calories

Advantage: All foods are nutritionally equal from a "keeping you alive" perspective

Disadvantage: Comparing 1000 calories of coffee to 1000 calories of beef is a little misleading, since 1000 calories of coffee would last years while 1000 calories of beef is 3 - 4 meals.

#### Per Kilogram

Advantage: Apples to apples comparison in a "quantity" sense. (Coffee won't show up as the leading offender)

Disadvantage: A kilogram of tomatoes has no where near as much nutritional value as a kilogram of beef.
